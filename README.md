# MusiPy
Python script to facilitate the process of language learning using song lyrics. 
As an input it receives a Spotify playlist, and outputs an Anki package with the translated and original song lyrics.
It currently supports Spanish translations. Support for more languages will be added in the close future.

# Future objectives
* Turn the script into a Flask API and create the front-end using React.
* Create a flashcard system on the website to avoid depending on third party apps.
* Enhance the script time perfomance or use a DB to store previously searched songs to provide a better user experience.
